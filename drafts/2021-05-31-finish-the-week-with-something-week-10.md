Started working on a very simple Domain Driven Design ish project to hone my reflection skills in C#. I've also
set up a dev/prod environment (for my use case of having 0 users, I don't need separate dev and production environment
(yes I know, this is terrible practice)). This week I need to setup the devops for the project and I need to
containerize the application, set up CI/CD pipeline.
