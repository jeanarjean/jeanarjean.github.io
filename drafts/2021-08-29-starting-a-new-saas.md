I launched a print store on this website back in december 2020, since then I've had this idea of making an e-commerce building website
specifically tailored to artist. Existing e-commerce solutions are pretty generic and take a lot of effort in order to tailor it to whatever
you want to sell. What I'm hoping to do is to release a turn-key solution for artists to sell print of their art.

The goal is for it to be as easy as possible for an artist to open a shop with as little setup as possible.
