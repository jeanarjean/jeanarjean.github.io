There's lots of videos about self-improvement, about cutting unhealthy habits, about focusing on yourself and not on relationships.

These videos make sense in a vacuum, but they honestly make no sense in the context of life. I get what they meant, focus, focus, focus and you'll
get what you want, what you work towards. However, they miss the point that humans need to rest, they need moments of happiness to put things in perspective,
to think things over. Rushing to the next achievement is great but a little living here and there makes sure you stay sane and can put the best of yourself out there 
when in matters. 

# Building Confidence
My life changed for the better when I started investing a lot in my fitness, I bought a nice road bike on a whim and biked that motherfucker hard all summer. I started
seeing a huge change on my mood, I started being truly happy and super confident. I used to be unable to even talk to a girl I didn't know at a bar, now I do this shit,
I get woman now, I'm not afraid, I didn't use a LIFE HACK or some fucking book, I just worked on myself, I **BUILT** this confidence, I earned it. I get the same confidence
boost when I do the hard stuff, when I work on my building a business instead of jerking off or playing video games.

# Relationships
These videos also talk about how bad having a girlfriend can be for you. Having the wrong girlfriend is indeed terrible for you.
But having a girlfriend who cares about you, who encourages you in your fastlane journey, who makes you happy, who take care of you, that's a huge boon in someone's life, it helps you **GROW**, helps you become the person you want to be, the **MAN** who handles shit.
Surrounding yourself with friends who get your vision, who encourages you and don't shit on your dreams is also amazing, you push them further and they push you further too.

The fastlane is a long road, take care of yourself and enjoy the painful road in the best way possible :).
