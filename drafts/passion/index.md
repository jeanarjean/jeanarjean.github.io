Growing around video games can be a curse, my whole life I was chasing
adrenaline, excitation, newness and dopamine through video games. Playing video games, I could be completely immersed,
I could forget about time, food, the toilet, that I had shit to do or that something's wrong.

Warcraft 3, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Counter Strike: Source and League of Legends were my jams and the love of my life. They
allowed me to escape and feel good.

I've associated the feeling I get when playing video game to what someone must 
feel like when someone is doing something he's passionate about. Growing up, everything else 
felt boring to me, why go to a party when I could be having fun playing 
video games, why help my dad when I could be *fragging* people on the internet, why go outside
when I could be winning over other people in a match of Wintermaul War. Video games were my main
source of joy at the detriment of everything else.

It was weird to me when people asked me what my passion was, because I couldn't
tell, like I really didn't know, I really like video games and maybe they were my passion but admitting
in high school that I was a *no life* would have been tragic. I had seen the fall from grace of the last guy that came
out as a gamer and I wasn't joining him in his turtuous demise. So being a passionless kid
was my thing, playing video games all day and all night was also my thing, nothing felt better than video games to me.

Fast forward a couple of years and I was in the infamous situation where I had to make a career choice,
What does a gamer with no passion chooses? You guessed it, I chose Software Engineering.
Mom always told me I'm good with computers, what could go wrong? I know my way around Windows, I'm
always the one fixing computers. I built my own computer after all, that's complicated right? Being a programmer is my destiny, there's
no doubt about it.

# TODO, Add section about Photography, Edit Last Section
I'm now in College, programming is fun and I really did enjoy my first classes of programming,
but do I get THAT feeling I'm searching for while doing it? Not really, at times, I do enter the zone and lose track of time and really enjoy
programming but most of the time I do not and that's fine. I really like the rush but being in a constant hurry would burn me out.
Programming lends itself better to a relaxed mind anyway, a stressed in a hurry mind is asking for trouble. Anyway, coming back to passion,
I'm starting to realize my definiton of passion is wrong, maybe I won't get an adrenaline boost doing something I call my passion everytime
and that's fine.
I now realize that a childhood of consuming media has led me to a need for creation and I find a certain satisfaction and *valorisation*
programming and doing photography.
And to be honest I rarely get absorbed as much as when I was a kid playing video games anyway, so the *Feeling* has kind of went away.
I've also been finding a feeling of joy going out and photographing, the feeling of being on the hunt for an awesome shots gets me.
I'm pretty sure I can say I'm passionate about photography, video games and programming now.
