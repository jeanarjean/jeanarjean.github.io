looked into my eyes, told myself I wouldn’t become a cog, told myself to not let go of my dreams,
told myself to not let the fact that everyone else gave up on them affect me, told myself I’d never become them,
told myself to not let the multiple deceptions of the world kill my naivety, promised myself not to become a stubborn old man just yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Burned]]></title><description><![CDATA[I miss the innocence I had when I was a child The confidence that I would succeed at whatever I tried That when it would matter, I’d have no…]]></description><link>http://rorscharg.com/blog/burned/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://rorscharg.com/blog/burned/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2018 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I miss the innocence I had when I was a child&lt;br&gt;
The confidence that I would succeed at whatever I tried&lt;br&gt;
That when it would matter,&lt;br&gt;
I’d have no problem giving my best&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a few failures later,&lt;br&gt;
I’m terribly scared that I won’t live up to the expectations I’ve set upon myself&lt;br&gt;
That I won’t make it,&lt;br&gt;
fall behind,&lt;br&gt;
be forgotten&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m stressed,&lt;br&gt;
burned out of working and studying,&lt;br&gt;
of worrying that I’m falling behind when I’m not working,
of not being able to enjoy having nothing to do without work troubling my mind.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fast]]></title><description><![CDATA[I really wish things would go faster, I want to be motivated, to have a purpose, to end life in exhaustion because I’ve lived too much…]]></description><link>http://rorscharg.com/blog/fast/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://rorscharg.com/blog/fast/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 May 2018 22:26:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I really wish things would go faster,&lt;br&gt;
I want to be motivated,&lt;br&gt;
to have a purpose,&lt;br&gt;
to end life in exhaustion because I’ve lived too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School is slow, it slowly burns me out,&lt;br&gt;
turns me into a ghoul,&lt;br&gt;
slowly drags me through the mud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don’t care about money anymore,&lt;br&gt;
What I really want is to be fired up by something&lt;br&gt;
I want mind to be absorbed by something,&lt;br&gt;
lose track of time,&lt;br&gt;
go on endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to fall for a long time,&lt;br&gt;
Feel the wind striking my face,&lt;br&gt;
Feel the adrenaline of free falling.&lt;br&gt;
Not look back,&lt;br&gt;
Enjoy the moment&lt;br&gt;
forever&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
