One who must play, cannot play - James Carse, Finite and Infinite Games [^2]

** Light Yakuza 0 spoilers ahead, noting major **

The third chapter of Yakuza 0[^2] is named 'Gilded Cage', the chapter starts as a rich japanese man starts causing
trouble in a presitigious **cabaret**, the man thinking he can do anything, is interrupted by a young mysterious
man with an eyepatch, he is the manager of the cabaret, he handles the situation in an elegant way, he truly
plays with the man untill he gets him to admit his wrongs and to pay the tab of everyone in the **cabaret**
that night. 

This scene provoked a sense of **adoration** in me, that character that was going to be the protagonist of half
of the chapters of the game seemed so different than the first one, it looked to me like his chapters were
going to be less about struggle and more light-hearted, after all this character seemed very nimble, nothing
seemed to be able to hold him down.

Which is when the character is interrupted by another character and we learn that this act as a manager of the
cabaret is a punishement for the character, as a way of redeeming himself for his past wrongs, the mysterious
eye patch man has to make money through the cabaret and pay it to its owner indefinately.


Reading Finite and Finite Game by James Carse[^2] has made me realize I was in a sort of gilded cage too, I made
the choice of going to college (I was strongly encouraged by my parents but the choice was still mine to make), this lead up to me accumulating a considerable of debt, I looked at college as a something I had to go through
in order to live a good life after, I was expecting to be free after college, to truly live the life I always
wanted to live.

Now out of college, currently working, I feel a bit freer but not much, I still have to work, I have to pay
my debts, actually I guess I could just not pay them and see what happens, but my mind sees the debts as
an obligation. I do feel trapped, in a cage, working my shift and then being exhausted when it's over, this
feels horrible.

I want to live life freely, have enough money to work on what I want to work on, spending money on debt is what
I have to do right now, but what I really want to do is save my money in order to be able to spend time in the
way I really to spend it. I love my workplace and the people I work with but as James Carse has said, one who
must play cannot play, and this is how I feel right now. I have to play and end up feeling obligated to work,
obligated to perform, it is an obligation not a possibility.

Yet I refuse to see this gilded cage as an end, I refuse to do like I did in college where I saw it as something
I must go through, something I really wanted to get over with and despised, hated. I want to enjoy my time now, be nimble although I'm in a sort of cage,
make the most out of it, life is fragile and the end is something we might never be able to anticipate. 

To making the most out of it.
