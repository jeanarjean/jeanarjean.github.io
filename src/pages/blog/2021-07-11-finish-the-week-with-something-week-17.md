# Summary
A bit of Game Dev, a bit of bike mechanic work and I finished reading C# In Depth

# Game Dev
Followed Amir Rajan and published my first ever indie game which isn't actually a game but a simple dvd sleep screen, and instead of the
DVD logo, I've put my friends face on there. It was the first time I touched DragonRuby which is a game engine in Ruby developed by Ryan C.
Gordon, one of the person behind SDL, and Amir Rajan, the creator of notably the Dark Room. I really DragonRuby at this point, it takes
a code first approach which to me is a major positive point for the engine, I tend to dislike game engine with a heavy coupling to their GUIs, it makes developing a game much more laborious as you have to figure out where everything is and your interaction with the engine is 
restricted by how the interface expects you to interact with it. Most importantly, it's really fun to be able to interact directly with
every part of the engine programmatically as this gives me a lot more flexibility. I love being able to read the doc of the game engine
without having to refer to videos which show me where things in the game engine are.

# Bike Mechanic
This week I learned how to adjust the front derailleurs of my bike, it was pretty shite overall and it took me two hours to get it kind of 
right, but I'm glad I did it, it's always fun to learn how the things you learn work and being able to repair it yourself.

# C# in depth
I finished reading C# in Depth by Jon Skeet, it was a really great experience to learn how the language was designed and to go through a lot
of C# features that I didn't understand fully, hopefully having read this book will make a better C# programmer by knowing more about every
nook and cranny of the language.

# Reading / Books
I feel like I should spend more time reading, my head has been pretty empty which I like since it allows me to focus, however my lack of
reading this year has made me pretty much incapable of having exciting new ideas. I read TOO much last year (especially given my slow
reading speed) and I didn't have enough time to digest the 23 books I read, there was a lot to be excited about in these books, but since
I read too much, I couldn't give each books enough thoughts. I told myself I wouldn't do the same mistake this year by reading way less,
but I feel that this time it's really not enough reading. 

Anyway, I've been reading The Making of Prince of Persia by Jordan Mechner which is a 
collection of journal entries during the years he worked on the original Prince of Persia, it's very interesting but not giving me new ideas.
