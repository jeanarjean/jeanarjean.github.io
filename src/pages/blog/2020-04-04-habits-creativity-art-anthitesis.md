Habits are really great, they make you move forward when you don't feel like moving forward. Habits force you to make
progress on your project. They're great at that, they do the job, but they're forced. The big
problems of habits is they make you *feel* forced to do something.

When you feel forced to do something, it feels like a drag, the task also seem much more harder
than it really is. In his article *Speed Matters*, James Somers argues that *"Part of the activation energy required to start any task comes from the picture you get in your head when you imagine doing it. It may not be that going for a run is actually costly; but if it feels costly, if the picture in your head looks like a slog, then you will need a bigger expenditure of will to lace up."*[^1]. I believe that tasks we force ourselves to do because
we consider them a daily habit lose their charm. We lose the enjoyment that we can get from doing
something by turning it into a chore.

Turning things I enjoy in daily habits is probably what doesn't work, I want to be great at programming, so I told myself
that developping the habit of programming every day on side project would be great thing to do. However, now, progrmaming on side projects feels like more work. An
addditional amount of stress I impose on myself.
I want to program  because I feel like it, because I'm excited by the idea of building something great.
Instead I end up programming because I feel like my life depends on it, because if I don't follow through with my habits my life will have been a waste where my potential was never truly fulfilled. 

I've seen a lot of comments on internet forums these days (maybe not that many but w/e), about the culture of
enjoyment or the culture of feeling good. How that culture is too wide spread and make for people with misguided priorities, I tend to
agree, seeking enjoyment make us go for the quick fix to our problems and turn us into all kinds of 
junkies. Yet, I cannot quite give up on the idea that my purpose in life shouldn't feel like a chore, it should
be something I truly belive in, something much greater than a feeling of obligation I get from *forming daily habits*.
Programming is a creative endeavour, game development probably even more so. Creative endeavours need love,
they need genuine passion, they're not some fancy daily habits, they're a product of the human genius. Of devoted passion.

It is said in *Atomic Habits* by James Clear that you should develop habits based on your identity.
*“With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.”*
Yet the person I want to become is not someone who is led by mundane imposed one hour a day of side project programming, it's a person who
programs because he's passionate about the problem, the solution and the product. I'll probably end up programming on side projects every day
anyway, but in an enjoyable way. 


# The Genius of the Subconscious.
In the book *Steve Jobs* by *Walter Isaacson*[^3], it is said that people working with Steve Jobs always had to make their
ideas seem like Steve Jobs' in order for him to like them. I suspect humans have the same relationship with their things imposed on them, when something 
feels imposed to them, the *imposition* makes them unable to enjoy the moment, all they have in mind is that they're doing something because they need to,
not because they want to. Daily **Forced** habitts are probably mostly the same.
