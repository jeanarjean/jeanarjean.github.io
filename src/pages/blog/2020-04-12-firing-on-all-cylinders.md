# Chasing the Past
I used to live a pretty monastic life, where I reduced my game consumption and high dopamine hobbies
to none, it was a very productive time, but also a very boring time, I was basically always bored.

Nowadays I'm back to a more dopamine intensive diet, and I don't know if confinement is at fault, but
I'm not feeling very good, I tire quickly. I need distraction, I'm very afraid of boredom, I am eternally
scared from feeling bored and having htis feeling of boredom strain my brain. It's that weird thing that
tire you, I've become a dopamine fiend, I don't enjoy the work I do and then I overcompensate with video
game consumption.

I'm starting a new role next week, which might make me more interesting in my day to day, however
the issue is I'm afraid to waste my energy at work, I hold back, not wanting to waste it all,
and that is affecting my enjoyment of it. It's gross tho.	


Jogging. exercice, Intense. stop drinking, less games.
