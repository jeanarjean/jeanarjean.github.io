# Summary
Ran, bought a bicycle, setup the docker image publishing pipeline.

# Running
Ran 4 days in a row last week, managed to push my personal best to 5km in 25 minutes which brings my pace to 5min/km.

# Cycling
Bought a bike, it's god damn fast, it's very fun, will probably use it all summer. Climbed Mount Royal yesterday, was 
really fucking fun, really makes me want to be more active, it seems the day I don't bike/run, I'm an unhappy sloth (
although most sloths look happy, maybe I should learn something from them).

# Devops
Set up a CD pipeline to release the docker image into a private Cloud Ocean docker registry.
