I miss the innocence I had when I was a child  
The confidence that I would succeed at whatever I tried  
That when it would matter,  
I'd have no problem giving my best

Now a few failures later,  
I'm terribly scared that I won't live up to the expectations I've set upon myself  
That I won't make it,  
fall behind,  
be forgotten

I'm stressed,  
burned out of working and studying,  
of worrying that I'm falling behind when I'm not working, 
of not being able to enjoy having nothing to do without work troubling my mind.
