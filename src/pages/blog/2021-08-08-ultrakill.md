I recently finished playing what is out of ULTRAKILL (the game is still in early access and some acts from it are still missing), however I paid 20 or so dollars for it and I've got to say it has been
worth it. ULTRAKILL is a straight up dopamine overdose in the best kind of way, it pushes you in a state of flow within minutes of having completed the first levels which are a lot slower, the game
picks up pace as soon as you grab the shotgun. The movements are smooth and powerful, you feel like a god damn badass playing this, not because of some phony quick time events during a cutscene
where the game is playing itself, because you are controlling every inch of your character, you are in control and you are powerful but fragile. Movement is the only way to stay alive, camping is most
of the time not a viable option. ULTRAKILL Is wonderful. It makes you feel there, it makes you forget about your life, it is one of the purest of experience, a complete joy to play.

A huge part of the experience is also the soundtrack which is just amazing, it fits the gameplay and ease you into the game. _A thousand Greetings_ is a wonderful calming song which seems to have no place
into an action packed game into this one, but it somehow works as the song itself is _remixed_ into hardcore versions of itself during the following 2 songs.

I can't recommend this game enough, for sure the game isn't complete yet, but what the game lacks in longetivity (even then one could argue seeking perfect scores and finding secrets add quite a lot of
longetivity to the game), it makes up in quality.
