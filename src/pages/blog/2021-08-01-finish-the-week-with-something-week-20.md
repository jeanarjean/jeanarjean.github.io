# Summary
This week I worked on absolutely nothing, week was full of responsibility and I didn't have time to progress on anything, although I didn't even have anything I wanted to work on this week, I should find something for this week.

# Cycling
I finished my first solo century ride last weekend, it was a lot of fun and I pushed myself in order to keep a pace of 25km/h. It's crazy how much cycling has changed my life, 
I now look forward to doing physical activity where I used to find it a drag in the past. I really
love cycling, I love how it makes me socialize with people, I love how much it absorbs my attention, I love the speed, I love the climbs and I really want to improve.
It's a really amazing sport and I want to push myself further, it's fucking amazing. Also it's nerdy as shit, there's ton of knowledge about cycling and it's way deeper
than it looks.
