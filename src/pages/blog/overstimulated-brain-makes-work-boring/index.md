I've done work on side projects before (didn't manage to release something major yet). I like programming, but when I start spending too much time doing it, it loses its meaning, charm and magic and  becomes a chore.

When I was working on side projects, I wasn't excited to go to work and solve problems anymore, I'd still be pretty productive anyway but it wasn't as fun. When you spent two hours working the evening before, being at work working again is not as nice as when you're completely rested. 

I think side projects shouldn't be in the same field, or different enough from your day job so your brain doesn't think you're doing the same thing. Reducing the amount of time spent on the side project each week might also work.
