I was in disgust, I went mad, I rushed to the bathroom, I looked at the mirror, looked at myself,
looked into my eyes, told myself I wouldn't become a cog, told myself to not let go of my dreams,
told myself to not let the fact that everyone else gave up on them affect me, told myself I'd never become them,
told myself to not let the multiple deceptions of the world kill my naivety, promised myself not to become a stubborn old man just yet.
