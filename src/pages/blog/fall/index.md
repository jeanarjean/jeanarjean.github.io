I really wish things would go faster,  
I want to be motivated,  
to have a purpose,  
to end life in exhaustion because I've lived too much.

School is slow, it slowly burns me out,  
turns me into a ghoul,  
slowly drags through the mud.

I've given up on being rich,  
I feel like I really don't care much about money anymore  
What I really want is to be fired up by something  
I want mind to be absorbed into something,  
lose track of time,  
go on endlessly.

I want to fall for a long time,  
Feel the wind striking my face,  
Feel the adrenaline of free falling.  
Not look back,  
Enjoy the moment  
forever
