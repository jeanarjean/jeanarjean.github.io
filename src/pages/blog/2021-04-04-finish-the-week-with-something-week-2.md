I recently came across this 
[Patrick Mackenzie article (aka Patio11)](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing) 
where he talks about finishing the week with something you can show people in 
order to build a huge body of work over the course of one's lifetime.

This is week 2 since I started doing this, I didn't end up finishing what I was working on during the first week so 
there's no first week post, but I'm hoping to publish something here every week in order to showcase what I've done.

This week I opened a [pull request](https://github.com/crsnbrt/keysim/pull/51) for [keyboardsimulator.xyz](https://keyboardsimulator.xyz/),
keyboardsimulator is a Three.JS application to test out layouts and keycaps combinations for keyboards.
 I wanted to test keycaps on a layout similar to the upcoming GMMK Pro,
  so I created a layout similar to the GMMK Pro, I also had to program the render for a knob which is part of the 
  GMMK Pro and needed for the layout to be complete. The color of the knob is changeable in the case options panel on the left.
