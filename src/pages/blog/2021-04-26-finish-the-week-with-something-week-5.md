# Summary
The two last weeks were failures programming wise, I didn't work on side projects related to programming although I wanted to, I did however work on a goal I have set back in August 2020 which is to reach the Master division in Starcraft 2 in a year.

# Starcraft 2 
When I decided to reach master division, I was diamond 3 and at 3400 MMR, which is approximately 900 MMR from my goal (the Master division starts at around 4300 MMR).

 I ended last week at 4066 which is 250 MMR from my goal which isn't too bad, although the higher MMR I have, the harder the enemies I face, therefore the closer to my goal I am, the harder it becomes.

One thing I have certainly noticed over the past few months is that my abilities to play Starcraft 2 well
is very dependant on two things. 

For one, how much mental energy I currently have when I play the game strongly affects my play, I'd estimate the effect of playing when my mental energy is low to affect my play by around 300 MMR which means that if I'm usually 4000 MMR player, when I play tired, I play at the level of a 3700 MMR player. 

Another one is my philosophy of the game is at this point in time, since Stacraft 2 is a strategy the game, the way you approach the game can vary a lot, hence, by shifting my mindset and changing the way I approach the game, I can come up with new strategies and tweaks to my current strategies in order to improve my play. Starcraft 2 is a game of brains and brawns, on one hand there is a very high execution skill cap and on the other hand you also need to play around your opponent, react to his play, anticipate what he'll do and outdo what he'll do. Keeping an open mind and always finding new ways to overcome what your opponent is doing is key to success.

## Progress
As a I said previously, over the year my MMR has improved by around 650 MMR, the improvement has been far from a linear progression, there was a lot of inconsistencies in my play that can be explained by continuing to play on a bad days, or focusing on improving my skills and sacrificing wins in the short term in order to win more games in the long term. There are multiple ways to *crutch* improvement, such as doing cheesy build order or using cheap shortcuts such as the F2 key in order to select your whole army. These crutches are what allow you
to artificially be a better player in the short term and sacrifice long term improvement.
