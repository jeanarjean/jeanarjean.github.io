# Summary
Cycling, DNS and shower thoughts.

# Cycling
Did my longest ride ever this weekend, it was a lot of fun, I rode 118km in 4,5 hours, it was a blast, I want to go again, and go faster and
for a longer ride.

# Programming
Fixed DNS issues, huitoctobre.com and echo.huitoctobre.com are now online, it's gonna be really easy from now on to deploy new side projects,
I should probably migrate from separate load balancers to a single ingress, but that's for another day I guess.

# Thoughts
Been thinking I lost the curiosity I had when I was younger, I used to want to know everything, nowadays I'm just burned on learning, it
seems I need to know so much for work that when it comes to learning out of work hours, it feels like work too.
