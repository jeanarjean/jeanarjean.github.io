# Summary
I worked on my side project hub deployment, I worked on a couple of game dev projects and I've finished reading The Making of Prince of Persia.

# Devops
I used to have several Load Balancers under Kubernetes exposing 2 services, now I have a single ingress which redirects the traffic towards
the right service. This reduces my costs related to IP addresses which should decrease my already low cost significantly.

# GameDev
I developed [the game I made last week further](https://jeanarjean.itch.io/boux), instead of being a simple face going across the screen, there's now something that happens when you click on the screen. I also worked on a [*slightly* more elaborate game](https://jeanarjean.itch.io/fatdandy) where the goal of the
game is to click on the left mouse button or right mouse button when one of the item falling reaches a line on the screen (kind of like
a rhythm game).

# The Making of Prince of Persia
I finished reading [The Making of Prince of Persia by Jordan Mechner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12917506-the-making-of-prince-of-persia). It was a really good book, I'm glad I read it, I've published my favorite excerpts from the book [here](/blog/2021-07-18-the-making-of-prince-of-persia-favorite-passages).
