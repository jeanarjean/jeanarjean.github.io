# Summary
Biked a lot, got nothing done programming wise, amazing week. I'm moving this week, I'll have more time for side project stuff once I'll be 
settled.

# Cycling
Biked 139 km last week, and went up a total of 1171m. At the beginning of the week, I was really afraid to go downhill,
 my back wheel vibrated a lot. Turns out my wheel isn't true and at high speed it vibrates a bit, once I knew this,
the next times I went downhill, I didn't panic when I felt the  wheel vibrate and I could really enjoy the ride. Going downhill on a bike
is an amazing experience, the feeling of speed at 60 km/h is just something else. I really love the idea of suffering going up the hill in
order to earn the downhill.
