I was in disgust, I went mad, I rushed to the bathroom, I looked at the mirror, looked at myself,
looked into my eyes, told myself I wouldn't become a cog, told myself not to let go of my dreams,
told myself not to let the fact that everyone else gave up on themlves affect me, told myself I'd never become them,
told myself to keep my childish naivety alive, promised myself not to become a stubborn old man just yet.
