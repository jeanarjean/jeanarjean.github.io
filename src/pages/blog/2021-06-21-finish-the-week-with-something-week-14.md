# Summary
Finished moving, biked, deployed my side project.

# Cycling
Biked 120 km last week with 1413m ,I'm getting better at climbing and I really enjoy it too, I'm also getting better at going downhill and turning
at high speed by shifting my weight on the bike.

# Kubernetes
Deployed my side project using Kubernetes, the simple application is now here http://104.248.110.222/, I need to find a way to use a single IP and map different project to the same url (but different path), I'll work on this this week.
