As someone who is very often working on side projects, I constantly go from:

1. Being excited about working on side projects
2. Doing awesome work which I'm proud of
3. Slowly losing excitement every day.
4. Working hard and pushing through although I don't feel like it
5. Going full David Goggins, https://www.youtube.com/shorts/NrRvP5EK990
6. Getting stressed out because I'm forgetting why I'm building something.
7. Taking time off the project.
8. Getting bored.
9. Somehow remembering Socrates' saying: "The unexamined life is not worth living."
10. Putting things back in perspective and realizing how fun and exciting what I'm working on is
11. Looping back to step 1

That said, I'm enormously grateful to have a main job that I love doing and that enables me to spend time working on side projects. I'd love for my side projects
to take off and be successful, but the truth is I'm in a position where I can live a great life without it.
