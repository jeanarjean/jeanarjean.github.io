I really wish things would go faster,  
I want to be motivated,  
to have a purpose,  
to end life in exhaustion because I've lived too much.

School is slow, it slowly burns me out,  
turns me into a ghoul,  
slowly drags me through the mud.

I really don't care about money anymore,  
What I really want is to be fired up by something  
I want mind to be absorbed by something,  
lose track of time,  
go on endlessly.

I want to fall for a long time,  
Feel the wind striking my face,  
Feel the adrenaline of free falling.  
Not look back,  
Enjoy the moment  
forever
