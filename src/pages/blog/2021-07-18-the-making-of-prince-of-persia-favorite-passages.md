These are my favorites excerpts from [The Making of Prince of Persia by Jordan Mechner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12917506-the-making-of-prince-of-persia)

_There's actually a kind of pleasure in the thought of going a year without my journals, photo albums, TV, stereo, music, computer games, car, all that crap. it strips me down to my bare humanity._

_I told him I was thinking of moving to L.A.. It sounded good... but today, walking in the Village, the urge seize me to move back here instead. New York is part of me; it will always be **the** city. When I'm here, I feel real. I feel alive. I feel horny. How can I live anywhere else._

_Here I am, as free as it's possible for anyone to be — free to travel, work, fall in love — and I'm holding back like I'm waiting for my life to start. This is my life. It's not a preparation for anything — it's the thing itself. I have got to remember that._

_Sometimes I wish I could cut loose from all this stuff — the computer games, the wanting to be a filmmaker, the endless self-promotion. I'm so bored with my arsenal._

_I wish I could be like Patrick just for a little while.... so that people would come to me because I'm cool and it makes them feel more alive just to be with me, and not because of anything I've done, or might accomplish in the future._

_I wish I had nothing to lose._

_"You have a dream life," she said. "You're travelling, you have friends. What exactly is the problem?"_

_I'm behaving like someone who's convinced they're going to die young._

_Like these three months in paris are months I've stolen, and it could end at any moment._

_About sixteen people have told me I'm "timid." even Jamil, the other night, remarked, "When you first came, you were very quiet. Now you're starting to relax more. I can see the difference."_

_"OK," Patrick said. "You want me to tell you your life story? I'm drunk enough for it."_
_He said: "You'll become a director and a producer and all the things you want to be, but you won't be a start. You'll never be a guy like Coppola who takes the spotlight, who climbs the steps of Cannes with a crowd watching him and says 'This is me, I did this, I'm a genius.' You'll be the guy in. the shadows. The people who know you and work with you will respect you, but it won't make you happy, because what you really want is to beat this shyness that's in you. You want to be the cool guy, the hot dude who has the spotlight and who everybody gathers around. But this shyness you have will prevent you. Every time you have a chance to be the center of attention, you'll deflect it. You'll say 'Oh, this wasn't really my success, I'm just a little guy.'"_

_What am I looking for, anyway? I didn't find it in New York or California or Spain or Paris, so now I'm going to look for it Cuba... and I still don't know what it is, or where all this is leading._

_There's something I don't understand. Here you are, you've got this great life, you're so free, and yet you act so conservative. You act like you and Sophie work in the same job and you don't want to have any bad feelings in the office. What are you trying to protect? Why not just act like a child? Napoleon, Charles de Gaulle, they all acted like children. They saw something and they wanted it. You're like that when you talk about your computer games. You have a dream and you're going to make it happen. Children are tyrants, they don't care who they hurt to get what they want. Why are you such an adult when it comes to love?_

"_You know I hate you?" he said. "It's so goddamned easy for you. You're rich, you're creative, you're good-looking, you speak five fucking languages, you can dance, and you're not arrogant! If I had your life. I'd be having such a good time... but you don't even seem to be enjoying it!" (...)_

_It's only what Patrick's been telling me all along. there's this thing inside me that makes me hold back. That dry adult whisper that counsels prudence, caution, thrift... Why? I'm fighting it on the big stuff, but on small stuff it's winning._

_It's good that I'm doing this train game. I should spend the money and not worry about it. The conservative impulse, at this point, is not my friend. If I'm not prepared to roll the dice now, when I'm young and on top of the world and the cash is rolling in, when will I ever be?_

_I know myself well enough to know that whatever happens, it won,t be my excesses I'll regret, it'll be the things I held myself back from doing. In all my life I've never yet give a present so lavish, or made a gesture so expansive, or indulged a pleasure so recklessly that I regretted it later. Whereas there are so many things I look back on now and think: "That was one of the high points, that moment will never come again, why did I hold back?"_
