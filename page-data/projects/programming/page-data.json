I really liked that it was the simplest of thing to publish\nto <a href=\"https://itch.io/\">itch.io</a> with DragonRuby. It made iterating a game really fast and rewarding as you could easily share your progress with your\nfriends. I ended up making two games, <a href=\"https://jeanarjean.itch.io/boux\">boux</a> and <a href=\"https://jeanarjean.itch.io/fatdandy\">fatdandy</a>. The sound is messed up\non the html versions and the games don't work on mobile but it is what it is.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jeanarjean/dragonrubygamedev\">&#x3C;/> Ruby</a></p>\n<h2>jeanarjean.com store</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://jeanarjean.com/store\"><img src=\"./store.png\"></a></p>\n<p><em>December 2020 - Now</em>\nIn december 2020, it had been 3 years since I started photography and I had always been interested by entrepreneurship so I decided to open\nmy first store. A place where I could sell prints of my photos. I created a store section in my website, which includes 10 items, 3 options for print size,\na cart section which lets the shopper combine prints in one order and is fully integrated with <a href=\"https://stripe.com/\">Stripe</a>. CSS and React was done by hand, no help from external UI libraries. I use <a href=\"https://www.gelato.com/\">Gelato</a> to manage orders and have the prints printed and shipped.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jeanarjean/jeanarjean.github.io/tree/develop\">&#x3C;/> GatsbyJS, Stripe, HTML, CSS</a></p>\n<h2>SDL2 Mech Game</h2>\n<p><em>June 2019 - June 2020</em></p>\n<p>A game I made to familiarize myself with C++, game development and entity component systems. I used minimal tools to make the game including\n<a href=\"https://www.libsdl.org/index.php\">Simple DirectMedia Layer 2 (SDL2)</a>, a cross-platform library to access low-level APIs of the platform the game runs on,\n<a href=\"https://box2d.org/\">Box2D</a> as the 2D physics engine, <a href=\"https://github.com/skypjack/entt\">entt</a> as the Entity Component System, <a href=\"https://cmake.org/\">CMake</a> as the build tool and <a href=\"https://conan.io/\">Conan</a> as the package manager.</p>\n<p>The game was originally just a version tracked tutorial of <a href=\"https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/\">Lazy Foo' famous SDL/Game programming tutorial</a>, I then\nstarted experimenting with the tutorial, changing the sprite to the face of DOOM, adding gravity to the sprite which applied downward speed to the sprite\nevery game tick. I then transformed the tutorial into an object-oriented project since this is what we still learned at my school in 2019 (GET WITH THE\nTIME <a href=\"https://www.etsmtl.ca/\">Ã‰TS</a>, COME ON).</p>\n<p>One thing led to another, I then needed a matrix library with led me to <a href=\"https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page\">Eigen</a>. The docs for Eigen\ntold me the best way to get Eigen running in my project was to use <a href=\"https://conan.io\">Conan</a>, the C++ package manager, so I added Conan to my project,\nmessed with my CMake configuration to plug Conan packages into it and we were ready to go again.</p>\n<p>At this point in time, I was very interested in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system\">Entity Component Systems(ECS)</a>, to me object oriented\nprogramming made no sense at all when it came to game development, I didn't understand why the objects themselves should be responsible for rendering\nthemselves and operating their physics, there had to be external <strong>system</strong> responsible for it. After trying very very unsuccesfully to create my own\nECS, I found out about <a href=\"https://github.com/skypjack/entt\">entt</a>, and boy it was great. I migrated my use of SDL to Conan too which wasn't too easy since I\nran into some DEBUG_LEVEL_ITERATORS issue which at the time I had no idea what it meant.</p>\n<p>THEN, I wanted physics, real complicated physics, so I started creating my own physics system, until I realized that was its own side project and it would\nbe longer than making a game, I decided to use <a href=\"https://box2d.org/\">Box2d</a>, which integrated eh poorly with entt but it was all good, it still worked and\nit was a much better option than creating my own.</p>\n<p>I then created a way for sprites to be played in my game, I created a little function to read aseprite export format which allowed me to play games, I then\nadded music and sound effect to the game. I then realized, if I wanted my game to have levels, I should be able to make games using an external tool and\nimport it into my game, so I created another function to read tilemaps from an exported format (I don't remember which one I was using).</p>\n<p>And at this point I kind of had a game. I had set a goal for myself to have a working level and ship it. I reached my goal, and sent the binary to\nmy friends, it was barely a game but I had put so much effort into it, I was pretty proud of the mess I had created. And I still sucked at C++ and CMake.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jeanarjean/jeanarjean.github.io/tree/develop\">&#x3C;/> C++, SDL2, entt, Box2D</a></p>\n<h2>is it 4pm yet</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://isit4pmyet.com/index.html\"><img src=\"./isit4pmyet.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>March 2020</em></p>\n<p>A simple clock for 8 to 4 workers.

A note could be assigned to more than one topic and\nevery topic was readable chronologically in its own page. It worked pretty much the same way as the tags on this website. Development was abandoned because I discovered Notion that I now use to build a personal knowledge base and started using my own note taking system that is simply a git repository with\nmarkdown files.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jeanarjean/brainy_dump\">&#x3C;/> Elixir, VueJS, Phoenix, Postgres, Auth0, Digital Ocean</a></p>\n<h2>Desert Toy Train Animation</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://jeanarjean.com/desert-train-threejs/\"><img src=\"./deserttrain.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>February 2019</em></p>\n<p>An animation of a train rolling on tracks made using ThreeJS. I made it while I was following a computer graphics class in University and I was curious to see what in-browser rendering could do. I was pleased to learn ThreeJS was very easy to use and quick to learn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jeanarjean/desert-train-threejs\">&#x3C;/> ThreeJS</a></p>\n<h2>jeanarjean.com</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://jeanarjean.com/\"><img src=\"./jeanarjean.png\"></a></p>\n<p><em>May 2018 - Now</em></p>\n<p>I've been maintaining this website for a few years and it's been through a few iterations. At first it was a website with a Node.js server hosting\nlinks to my photos. I made it to learn frontend development and javascript since at the time I was a total newbie in these areas.\nIt then transitioned to a kind of portfolio/personal website with a blog section. I migrated the website to Gatsby.js when I kept hearing about\nJekyll static websites and I was looking for a static website generator with which I could use React since I wanted to learn React. I also used the project\nas an opportunity to learn CSS, so I did all of the CSS by end, no frameworks, which I now very much regret since I wish I could just use a UI library to\nhave nice looking components quickly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jeanarjean/jeanarjean.github.io/tree/develop\">&#x3C;/> GatsbyJS, HTML, CSS</a></p>\n<h2>Simple Scoreboard</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://jeanarjean.com/simplescoreboard\"><img src=\"./simplescoreboard.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>April 2018</em></p>\n<p>A really simple scoreboard for 2 teams, I was pretty disappointed when the first google result for a simple score board wasn't an actual simple score\nboard so I decided to create one quickly. Made using boring technology, AKA plain old vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS so I shouldn't have to maintain it actively.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jeanarjean/simplescoreboard\">&#x3C;/> Vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS</a></p>\n<h1>Credits</h1>\n<p>this project page is inspired by this website, I thought it was clever to have my project section as a blog post instead of being a <em>modern</em> web design page with cards and such. It's a lot easier to maintain this\nway.\n<a href=\"https://legacy.t3.gg/projects\">https://legacy.t3.gg/projects</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Programming Projects","backgroundColor":"white","tags":[],"date":"September 30, 2021","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/programming/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-09-07-how-to-validate-automapper-configuration-using-unit-test/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Validate your AutoMapper Configuration using Unit Test","image":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2022-06-18-liveview-table-with-search-filter/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to create Phoenix LiveView tables with search filter","image":null}}}},
