I started running again.\nI am setting new goals for the future.</p>\n<h1>Starcraft 2</h1>\n<p>I accomplished my goal wednesday, I had set for myself the goal of reaching Master in SC2. It took me 9 months, I kind of wanted\nto start working on something else at times but I couldn't give up on my goal, I too often give up on things thinking they don't really matter, but I wanted to prove\nmyself I am able to become on of the best at something that is really hard, and I did. I think it's one of the hardest thing I've\ndone in life, like I could run a marathon, but that's a race against myself, it's not a 1v1 game, the dynamics and mentality are quite different.</p>\n<p>I don't know if all the philosophy I had towards the game actually mattered, it seems the day I reached master, I was playing with the only philosophy that I was\ngoing to win and reach Master that day, I had a few thoughts of failure, but I still managed to make it. On the final day, I reached\n4200 MMR for the first time, and then I reached 4300 MMR for the first time and when I reached 4330, I was promoted to master. I guess before that day, I thought I couldn't beat 4200 MMR and\nupwards players but during that day I beat very very good players with 400-600 MMR higher than mine. My worst matchup before wednesday was Terran vs Zerg, but on that day, it was my best matchup. It's\nlike a door had suddenly unlocked and I knew how to beat zergs every game. I took the right decisions, saved as much of my units as I could, and made the most out of my hellions which I\nused to use use passively. It seems my time practicing playing zerg might have shown me how zerg works. I could make better decisions because\nI knew this. I used to see zerg as this big\nunstoppable force, but now I knew how they wanted to play, and I could play around that, push them out of their comfort zone,\nmake them do stupid mistakes.</p>\n<p>I tend to win games where I'm active on the map, where I can pressure the opponent and make him commit mistakes,\nstaying back usually is a pretty bad option. In TvP, it's kind hard to have a\npresence on the map passed 3 minute mark and before you have stim researched, since stalkers and adepts are so good against reaper and without stim marines and marauders are trash, maybe going cyclone would be a good choice? </p>\n<p>I think I played for 4-5 hours straight on the final day, I used to think I couldn't do that, I used to stop playing as soon as my brain sent signals to stop,\nI sent signals to go back to my comfort zone, but on wednesday, I pushed past this fucking comfort zone, into greatness. I should do\nthis more often.</p>\n<p><em>MMR progression through the year</em>\n<img src=\"./mmr.png\">\nData provided by <a href=\"https://www.rankedftw.com/team/478340/#td=world&#x26;ty=c&#x26;ra=best&#x26;tyz=0&#x26;tx=a&#x26;tl=1\">rankedftw</a></p>\n<h1>Running</h1>\n<p>Also started running again, I ran 10km at a 6:35 minutes/km pace, it took me a while to recover but I believe it was worth it,\nI then ran a 8 km run at a 6:00 minutes/km pace which wasn't too shabby either.</p>\n<p>I don't know if I'm going to start running again, I like biking too, actually I prefer biking, but my god damn bike always seem to be breaking\nso it pisses me off to bike.</p>\n<h1>Future Goals</h1>\n<p>Now I need to settle on a new goal, many opportunities present to me, I could start a business, I could help people by doing volunteering\nwork, especially website related ones since it something that not everyone can do, I could grow my print business, that would involve creating a SERIOUS following on instagram, since I don't to annoy my closed ones with posts begging them to buy my work\non facebook, and if it's only people I know buying the fucking prints, it ain't a fucking business, it's a god damn charity.</p>\n<p>Starting a print business, would involve a shit ton of time spent on instagram, maybe money on ads, taking pictures that people like<br>\ninstead of street photography pictures which no one seem\nto want on their wall, I guess urban stuff isn't very very inspiring on your wall. There doesn't seem to be an alignment between what I want to do and what they want to buy.</p>\n<p>Conversion on instagram is also questionable. How the fuck do you build a following on instagram, I have no fucking idea, I guess you post regularly and you do collabs, you build a network,\nmaybe create/join an art collective. All I know is that solely posting pictures on Instagram doesn't cut it. When I shared a post about having new prints for sale on my website, I got a single visitor from\ninstagram out of 200 followers. It seems I'd have a shit ton of work to turn this into a successful business, which is fine, but I don't know if instagram is the answer.</p>\n<p>I feel like taking more pictures of people, just bringing my camera everywhere, always having it on me (actually wearing it, since otherwise I'm too lazy to take it out of my bad). I want to document life, not just\nthe street, everything.</p>\n<p>I'll give myself a week to set a goal, right now I'm thinking of setting a entrepreneurship one and fitness goal </p>\n<p>Entrepreneurship/Side Project</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Photo Business</li>\n<li>Start a SaaS</li>\n<li>Make an indie game</li>\n<li>Get involved in volunteering</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Physical</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run a marathon in a year</li>\n<li>Bulk up for the first time in my life at the gym, maybe have target lift weights I should achieve in a year.</li>\n<li>Bike a long ass journey somewhere in a year</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My programming philosophy has been getting pretty stale lately, I've been stuck in the C# and javascript world for a while, seeing something\nnew could be really helpful, I also should push my understanding of reflection in C# further.</p>\n<p>And I also need to read more, I've read a lot last year, but my thinking has been also pretty static, I don't have as many new ideas\nsince I'm not reading as much.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 8","backgroundColor":"white","tags":["weekly","life","starcraft","gaming"],"date":"May 17, 2021","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2021-05-16-finish-the-week-with-something-week-8/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-04-26-finish-the-week-with-something-week-5/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 5","image":null}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3868140423"]}
