I also added added analytics to my website which made it easy for me to track how many people visited</p>\n<h1>Prints</h1>\n<p>I've decided to manage the state of the cart manually using Redux, it was pretty easy to setup. I had to\nuse a cart as initially the website only let you purchase one print a time which didn't require any\nstate management. I integrate with Stripe, storing products ids in .env file. It's a lot of manual\nwork to setup a new print as I have to manually add the product ids in the .env file, and add the price\nfor the different sizes of prints.</p>\n<h1>Analytics</h1>\n<p>For analytics, I used panelbear, it was surprisingly easy to setup.</p>\n<p><em>Setting up panelbear in a Gatsby website</em></p>\n<deckgo-highlight-code language=\"javascript\" terminal=\"none\"  >\n          <code slot=\"code\">// gatsby-ssr.js\n\nconst PANELBEAR_SITE_ID = &quot;GETYOUROWNID&quot;;\n\nconst PANELBEAR_CONFIG = {\n  site: PANELBEAR_SITE_ID,\n  spaMode: &quot;history&quot;,\n  debug: false,\n};\n\nexport const onRenderBody = ({ setPostBodyComponents }) =&gt; {\n  setPostBodyComponents([\n    &lt;script\n      key=&quot;panelbear-analytics-src&quot;\n      async\n      src={`https://cdn.panelbear.com/analytics.js?site=${PANELBEAR_SITE_ID}`}\n    /&gt;,\n    &lt;script\n      key=&quot;panelbear-analytics-code&quot;\n      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{\n        __html: `\n          window.panelbear = window.panelbear || function() { (window.panelbear.q = window.panelbear.q || []).push(arguments); };\n          panelbear(&#39;config&#39;, ${JSON.stringify(PANELBEAR_CONFIG)});\n        `,\n      }}\n    /&gt;,\n  ]);\n};</code>\n        </deckgo-highlight-code>\n<p>Panelbear allowed me to determine instagram\nisn't such great a channel for me, as I got a single visit from there where as I got a lot more\nvisits from my facebook post.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./channel.png\" alt=\"\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 3","backgroundColor":"white","tags":["weekly","life","javascript"," opensource"],"date":"April 15, 2021","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2021-04-17-finish-the-week-with-something-week-3/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-04-04-finish-the-week-with-something-week-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 2","image":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-04-26-finish-the-week-with-something-week-5/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 5","image":null}}}},
