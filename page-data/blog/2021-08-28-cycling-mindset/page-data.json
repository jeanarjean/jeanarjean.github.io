Before this the longest distance I had a run in one day was 120km, so jumping to 270 km seemed like a big step but I was determined to see it through.</p>\n<p>I didn't expect my pace to be this fast to be honest, to be fair I was greatly helped by the wind, but even the day after, while cycling to my parent's home with the wind in my face, my pace was a lot better than I expected. When I cycled my first solo metric century (100km), I kept myself from exerting too much my muscles. So I was mostly resting most of the way. I thought during a 270km ride, I'd have to be in resting pace much of the way, but turns out I was able to push into my muscles a lot through the whole ride which I didn't expect myself to be able to do.\nIt seems cycling progress doesn't happen only when your muscles are getting stronger but also when you learn how much more you can push\nyourself, when you break what you previously thought were your limit. This probably applies a lot more to beginner, but I find this kind\nof improvement is a lot similar to how I got better at Street Photography, there's a huge part of photography that is technical, how to\nproperly expose the subject, how to properly frame the subject, how to correctly focus on the subject, yet in Street Photography, getting\ncloser to the subject is a game changer, it brings a whole new dimension to the pictures you take. It makes the photos intimate, it brings\nthe subject closer to OCCUPYING THE WHOLE FRAME. This improvement to street photography isn't technical, it is all about mindset, it's about\nfacing your fear of invading people's personal space, about facing your fear of people reacting badly to having a picture taken of themselves\nagainst their will, it's about fighting the fear in the hopes that the picture will be able to freeze a candid moment in time that will never\never happen again. To document life as it is today like the greats of Street Photography have done in the past.</p>\n<p>It was very fun to push myself through the whole way, I wasn't bored or anything, I was pretty excited at going the whole way and keeping a good pace while breaking barriers I had set upon myself.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./strava.png\" alt=\"\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cycling Mindset, First Imperial Century, Montreal to Quebec on a bicycle","backgroundColor":"black","tags":["cycling"],"date":"August 29, 2021","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/d1828a9a1bcb9b3f4641c149d21875dc/94cd4/argon18.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d1828a9a1bcb9b3f4641c149d21875dc/0f3a1/argon18.jpg 500w,\n/static/d1828a9a1bcb9b3f4641c149d21875dc/94cd4/argon18.jpg 757w","sizes":"(max-width: 757px) 100vw, 757px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2021-08-28-cycling-mindset/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-08-08-ultrakill/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ULTRAKILL","image":{"id":"5dd7ec02-e787-5031-8ccb-5b6ab374fbd0"}}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-09-04-how-to-fix-object-cycle-detected-properly-automapper/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Fix \"A possible object cycle was detected\" properly in your .Net project using AutoMapper","image":null}}}},
