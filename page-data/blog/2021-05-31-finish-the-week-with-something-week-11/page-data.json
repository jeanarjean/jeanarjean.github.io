I'm moving this week, I'll have more time for side project stuff once I'll be\nsettled.</p>\n<h1>Cycling</h1>\n<p>Biked 139 km last week, and went up a total of 1171m. At the beginning of the week, I was really afraid to go downhill,\nmy back wheel vibrated a lot. Turns out my wheel isn't true and at high speed it vibrates a bit, once I knew this,\nthe next times I went downhill, I didn't panic when I felt the wheel vibrate and I could really enjoy the ride. Going downhill on a bike\nis an amazing experience, the feeling of speed at 60 km/h is just something else. I really love the idea of suffering going up the hill in\norder to earn the downhill.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 11","backgroundColor":"white","tags":["weekly","cycling","devops"],"date":"June 08, 2021","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2021-05-31-finish-the-week-with-something-week-11/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-05-31-finish-the-week-with-something-week-10/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 10","image":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-06-21-finish-the-week-with-something-week-14/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 14","image":null}}}},
