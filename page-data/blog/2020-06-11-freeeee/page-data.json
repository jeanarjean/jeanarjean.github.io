The man is interrupted by a young mysterious\nman with an eyepatch, he is the manager of the cabaret, the manager handles the situation in an elegant way, he\nplays with the man untill he gets him to admit his wrongs and pay the tab for everyone in the cabaret\nthat night. </p>\n<p>This scene provoked a sense of admiration in me, the manager looked so nimble and agile, it seemed nothing\ncould bind him.</p>\n<p>Then the cabaret manager is interrupted by another character and we learn that being the manager of the cabaret is a punishment.\nThe manager aka the protagonist has not choice but to be the manager of the cabaret, to redeem himself for his past wrongs.

I do feel trapped, in a cage, I work my shift and when it’s over I’m exhausted, it seems all my productive\nenergy is going towards work and I can’t get out.</p>\n<p>I want to live life freely, have enough money to work on what I want to work on, spending money on paying back my debt is what\nI have to do right now, but what I actuallly want to do is save my money in order to be able to spend time in the\nway I really want to spend it. I love my workplace and the people I work with but as James Carse has said, whoever\nmust play cannot play, and this is how I feel right now. I have to play and I end up feeling obligated to work,\nobligated to perform, it is an obligation not a possibility.</p>\n<p>Yet I refuse to see this gilded cage as an end, I refuse to do like I did in college where I saw it as something\nI had to go through, something I really wanted to get over with, I don’t want to tell myself: “just pay your debt and life is gonna be\nfine after”. I want life to be good now, and that is a choice I can make right now, I can’t always postpone enjoying life to an uncertain future.\nI want to enjoy my time now, be nimble and agile although I’m in a sort of cage,\nmake the most out of it, life is fragile and I have to enjoy sailing when the sea is still calm.</p>\n<p>To making the most out of it.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189989.Finite_and_Infinite_Games\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189989.Finite_and_Infinite_Games</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/638970/Yakuza_0/\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/638970/Yakuza_0/</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Free","backgroundColor":"black","tags":["life"],"date":"June 12, 2020","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/5bf7941241c3b51695bdfe4ae7e49666/ab802/kidsseeghosts.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5bf7941241c3b51695bdfe4ae7e49666/32ee9/kidsseeghosts.jpg 500w,\n/static/5bf7941241c3b51695bdfe4ae7e49666/ab802/kidsseeghosts.jpg 820w","sizes":"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2020-06-11-freeeee/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-06-06-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-running-caffeine/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Running, Caffeine","image":{"id":"00d2b2d6-b20f-5b94-a002-b9e2ed1355a4"}}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3868140423"]}
