After a life of education, that wasn’t\nreally an option, I didn’t want to learn another proffession because I was too stupid to save my wrist.</p>\n<p>I started acknowledging I was being negligent of my body, it’s been falling apart for the past year and it’s something\nthat really shouldn’t happen to a 24 years old. I have a long lasting injury in my shoulder which I haven’t managed to recover from and which\nI haven’t taken the right amount of time to fix either. I’ve been negligent of myself.</p>\n<p>I took actions actions, I had to give myself a chance, I knew I had to start doing more physical exercices. I took a small detour however\nand decided to read <em>What I talk about when I talk about running</em><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> by <em>Haruki Murakami</em> which I ended up enjoying\na lot, it was a calm book by a man with much more life behind him than me, it was interesting to see similar questionings from someone considerably\nolder. Someone much older who is according to himself living the life he wants to live. I ended up really appreciating his philosophy of life, of running by necessity to keep himself healthy enough to continue\nwriting which is what he has decided his life is gonna be about.</p>\n<p>So, I started running, I run at least 5km almost every day, sometimes pushing for more. Since I’ve recently started running, I take a day or two off when\nI need it in order to give my legs a chance to rest and recover. Rest usually makes a huge difference when I start running again, my legs are much more sturdy\nand I don’t feel worried of hurting myself at all. (I wrote this before going for a run this morning and finding my legs pretty tired at the begining of the run).</p>\n<p>I wake up at 5:30am, I usually run first thing in the morning, I put on my headphones and listen to an audiobook. Some people have told me they cannot even\nimagine listening to something while running, for me it feels natural, it allows me to forget I’m running and just focus on listening. I also feel\nlike it might slow down my pace, I feel a lot faster while listening to music, but I’m not running with a competitive mindset, I like pushing myself, but I don’t care about not running the best time I can.</p>\n<p>One day I found myself programming for an hour or so after a run, without drinking any coffee.\nAt that moment, I realized that my previous stance on coffee, which is I need it in order to perform at work was completely wrong. I really don’t need coffee. I used to drink\ncoffee all day and felt absolutely terrible when I wasn’t drinking it, coffee also overstimulated me, it made me feel like I needed more stimulation than just working, I’d end up\nopening a thousand chrome tabs looking for something that would release a nice dose of dopamine in my head, I didn’t want to live like this anyomre, I wanted to be able to focus on\nthings genuinely. Going for a run also made me realize that running woke me up naturally and that I could be focused on programming afterwards.</p>\n<p>So I dropped coffee altogheter, it was a huge pain for the first few days, headaches and tiredness was common place, but then I started feeling much better. Now that the withdrawal symptoms are gone,\nI can do deep work again, and I only need a run in the morning to feel awake. I am no longer dependant to coffee. It’s been three weeks now, I’m very very happy about the decision,\nI am much healthier and the decision has already paid off in my opinion, but I’m sure will only be even more crucial as/if I get older.</p>\n<p>I’d say, the truest thing about all this is that I don’t feel much different, if anything it made me deadly bored, unexcited, don’t get me wrong, I don’t regret the decision, it brought me back to reality.\nLack of stimulants have brought me back to a peaceful life, a boring one, one which might be the envy of many, yet being in it feels horrible. Life has lost its lust, it is plain, there is nothing to be excited about.\nGetting rid of stimulants make me realize that maybe the life I’m living right now is due for major changes, that right now I am not very very happy, that it is in my power to make it happier and this is actually\nsomething to be excited about. Lack of stimulants is a blessing in disguise, it’s something that makes me question myself and this I am happy about.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Running, Caffeine","backgroundColor":"black","tags":["life"],"date":"June 07, 2020","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/23ebe98fdac2439b940537496e2f8c8e/883ab/peace.jpg","srcSet":"/static/23ebe98fdac2439b940537496e2f8c8e/32ee9/peace.jpg 500w,\n/static/23ebe98fdac2439b940537496e2f8c8e/2f7e7/peace.jpg 1000w,\n/static/23ebe98fdac2439b940537496e2f8c8e/883ab/peace.jpg 2000w,\n/static/23ebe98fdac2439b940537496e2f8c8e/3d25e/peace.jpg 2048w","sizes":"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/2020-06-06-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-running-caffeine/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-03-26-Why-I-Write/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why I Write","image":{"id":"26867572-949d-59fd-aa1c-c78f480521d7"}}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-06-11-freeeee/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Free","image":{"id":"14234ffa-e282-584c-9856-149611d15d86"}}}}}}
