I do feel trapped, in a cage, working my shift and then being exhausted when it’s over, this\nfeels horrible.</p>\n<p>I want to live life freely, have enough money to work on what I want to work on, spending money on debt is what\nI have to do right now, but what I really want to do is save my money in order to be able to spend time in the\nway I really to spend it. I love my workplace and the people I work with but as James Carse has said, one who\nmust play cannot play, and this is how I feel right now. I have to play and end up feeling obligated to work,\nobligated to perform, it is an obligation not a possibility.</p>\n<p>Yet I refuse to see this gilded cage as an end, I refuse to do like I did in college where I saw it as something\nI must go through, something I really wanted to get over with and despised, hated. I want to enjoy my time now, be nimble although I’m in a sort of cage,\nmake the most out of it, life is fragile and the end is something we might never be able to anticipate. </p>\n<p>To making the most out of it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"","backgroundColor":null,"tags":null,"date":null,"image":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/2020-06-09-freeeee/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-06-06-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-running-caffeine/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Running, Caffeine","image":{"id":"5992095e-4911-5ac9-89bc-27df153d153b"}}},"next":null}}}
