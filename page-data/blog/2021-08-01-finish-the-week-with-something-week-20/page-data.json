It's crazy how much cycling has changed my life,\nI now look forward to doing physical activity where I used to find it a drag in the past. I really\nlove cycling, I love how it makes me socialize with people, I love how much it absorbs my attention, I love the speed, I love the climbs and I really want to improve.\nIt's a really amazing sport and I want to push myself further, it's fucking amazing. Also it's nerdy as shit, there's ton of knowledge about cycling and it's way deeper\nthan it looks.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 20","backgroundColor":"white","tags":["weekly","cycling"],"date":"August 02, 2021","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2021-08-01-finish-the-week-with-something-week-20/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-07-18-finish-the-week-with-something-week-18/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 18","image":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-08-08-ultrakill/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ULTRAKILL","image":{"id":"99fe805d-2aea-54b8-b0e3-c7842daab7e4"}}}}},
