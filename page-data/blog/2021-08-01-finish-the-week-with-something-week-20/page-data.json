It's crazy how much cycling has changed my life,\nI now look forward to doing physical activity where I used to find it a drag in the past. I really\nlove cycling, I love how it makes me socialize with people, I love how much it absorbs my attention, I love the speed, I love the climbs and I really want to improve.\nIt's a really amazing sport and I want to push myself further, it's fucking amazing.
