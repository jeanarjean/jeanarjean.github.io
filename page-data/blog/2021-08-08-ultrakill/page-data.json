ULTRAKILL is a straight up dopamine overdose in the best kind of way, it pushes you in a state of flow within minutes of having completed the first levels which are a lot slower, the game\npicks up pace as soon as you grab the shotgun. The movements are smooth and powerful, you feel like a god damn badass playing this, not because of some phony quick time events during a cutscene\nwhere the game is playing itself, because you are controlling every inch of your character, you are in control and you are powerful but fragile. Movement is the only way to stay alive, camping is most\nof the time not a viable option. ULTRAKILL Is wonderful. It makes you feel there, it makes you forget about your life, it is one of the purest of experience, a complete joy to play.</p>\n<p>A huge part of the experience is also the soundtrack which is just amazing, it fits the gameplay and ease you into the game. <em>A thousand Greetings</em> is a wonderful calming song which seems to have no place\ninto an action packed game into this one, but it somehow works as the song itself is <em>remixed</em> into hardcore versions of itself during the following 2 songs.</p>\n<p>I can't recommend this game enough, for sure the game isn't complete yet, but what the game lacks in longetivity (even then one could argue seeking perfect scores and finding secrets add quite a lot of\nlongetivity to the game), it makes up in quality.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ULTRAKILL","backgroundColor":"rgba(214, 0, 0, 1)","tags":["gaming"],"date":"August 09, 2021","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/1e06b97a713e48a4cb39282a1d224b42/0e329/ultrakill.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1e06b97a713e48a4cb39282a1d224b42/0f3a1/ultrakill.jpg 500w,\n/static/1e06b97a713e48a4cb39282a1d224b42/a7715/ultrakill.jpg 1000w,\n/static/1e06b97a713e48a4cb39282a1d224b42/0e329/ultrakill.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2021-08-08-ultrakill/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-08-01-finish-the-week-with-something-week-20/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 20","image":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-08-28-cycling-mindset/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cycling Mindset, First Imperial Century, Montreal to Quebec on a bicycle","image":{"id":"ff2a4cfe-233b-5af8-ba2d-62a1574f2c6a"}}}}},
