I ended the week at 4066 which is 250 MMR from my goal which isn't too bad, although the higher MMR I have, the harder the enemies I face, therefore the closer to my goal I am, the harder it is for me to reach it and raise my MMR.</p>\n<p>One thing I have certainly noticed over the past few months is that my abilities to play Starcraft 2 well\nis dependant on two important things. </p>\n<p>For one, how much mental energy I currently have when I play the game strongly affects my play, I'd estimate the effect of playing when my mental energy is low to affect my play by around 300 MMR. </p>\n<p>Another one is what my philosophy of the game is at this point in time, since Stacraft 2 is a strategy the game, the way you approach the game can vary a lot, hence, by shifting my mindset and changing the way I approach the game, I can come up with new strategies and tweaks to my current strategies in order to improve my play. Starcraft 2 is a game of brains and brawns, on one hand there is a very high execution skill cap and on the other hand you also need to play around your opponent, react to his play, anticipate what he'll do and outdo what he'll do. Keeping an open mind and always finding new ways to overcome what your opponent is doing is key to success.</p>\n<h2>Progress</h2>\n<p>As a I said previously, over the year my MMR has improved by around 650 MMR, the improvement has been far from linear progression, there was a lot of inconsistencies that can be explained by continuing to play on a bad day, or focusing on improving my skills and sacrificing wins in the short term in order to win more games in the long term. There are multiple ways to <em>crutch</em> improvement, such as doing cheesy work order, using cheap shortcuts such as the F2 key in order to select your whole army. </p>\n<p><img src=\"./mmr.png\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 5","backgroundColor":"white","tags":["weekly","life","javascript"," opensource"],"date":"April 27, 2021","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2021-04-26-finish-the-week-with-something-week-5/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-04-17-finish-the-week-with-something-week-3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 3","image":null}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3868140423"]}
