Starcraft 2 is a game of brains and brawns, on one hand there is a very high execution skill cap and on the other hand you also need to play around your opponent, react to his play, anticipate what he'll do and outdo what he'll do. Keeping an open mind and always finding new ways to overcome what your opponent is doing is key to success.</p>\n<h2>Progress</h2>\n<p>As a I said previously, over the year my MMR has improved by around 650 MMR, the improvement has been far from a linear progression, there was a lot of inconsistencies in my play that can be explained by continuing to play on a bad days, or focusing on improving my skills and sacrificing wins in the short term in order to win more games in the long term. There are multiple ways to <em>crutch</em> improvement, such as doing cheesy build order or using cheap shortcuts such as the F2 key in order to select your whole army. These crutches are what allow you\nto artificially be a better player in the short term and sacrifice long term improvement.</p>\n<p><em>MMR progression through the year</em>\n<img src=\"./mmr.png\" alt=\"\">\nData provided by <a href=\"https://www.rankedftw.com/team/478340/#td=world&#x26;ty=c&#x26;ra=best&#x26;tyz=0&#x26;tx=a&#x26;tl=1\">rankedftw</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 5","backgroundColor":"white","tags":["weekly","life","starcraft"," gaming"],"date":"April 27, 2021","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2021-04-26-finish-the-week-with-something-week-5/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-04-17-finish-the-week-with-something-week-3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 3","image":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-05-16-finish-the-week-with-something-week-8/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Finish the Week with Something - Week 8","image":null}}}},
